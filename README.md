## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
- Optional: A code editor (e.g., VS Code) for customization.
- Optional: Git and a GitHub account for version control.

### Local Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Srijaanaa/srijana-portfolio.git
   cd srijana-portfolio
   ```
2. **Open the Project**:
   - Open `index.html` in a browser to view the site locally, or
   - Use a local server (e.g., VS Code Live Server extension) for a better development experience:
     ```bash
     npx live-server
     ```

### Deployment
To host the site online (e.g., on Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages):
1. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial portfolio commit"
   git push origin main
   ```
2. **Deploy**:
   - **GitHub Pages**: Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings, setting the source to the `main` branch.
   - **Netlify**: Drag and drop the project folder into Netlifyâ€™s dashboard or link your GitHub repo for automatic builds.
   - **Vercel**: Import the repo via Vercelâ€™s dashboard and deploy.

3. Update the following in `index.html` with your live domain:
   - `<meta property="og:url">`
   - `<meta property="og:image">`
   - `<meta name="twitter:image">`
   - Structured data (`url` and `sameAs`).

## Customization

- **Update Images**:
  - Replace files in the `photos/` folder with your own (`logo.png`, `photo1.jpg`, `photo.jpg`, `project1.jpg`, etc.).
  - Ensure `photo.jpg` (About Me) is portrait-oriented for the taller aspect ratio (220px Ã— 330px desktop).
- **Portfolio Projects**:
  - Edit the portfolio section in `index.html` to link to your actual GitHub repos or live demos:
    ```html
    <a href="https://github.com/your-username/your-repo" target="_blank" class="portfolio-btn">View Project</a>
    ```
- **Contact Form**:
  - Replace the Web3Forms `access_key` in `index.html` with your own:
    ```html
    <input type="hidden" name="access_key" value="your-access-key">
    ```
  - Get a free key at [Web3Forms](https://web3forms.com/).
- **Volunteering Section**:
  - Update the timeline in `index.html` with your experiences:
    ```html
    <div class="timeline-item">
      <span class="year">Year</span>
      <p>Your Role, Organization</p>
    </div>
    ```
- **SEO**:
  - Customize meta tags (`keywords`, `description`) and social media images for your branding.
